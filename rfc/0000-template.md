## Introduction

A short description of what the feature is. Try to keep it to a single-paragraph "elevator pitch" so the reader understands what problem this proposal is addressing.

## Motivation

Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the problem is that some typical pattern is currently hard to express, show how one can currently get a similar effect, and describe its drawbacks.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe how they work. Show how your solution is better than current workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design
